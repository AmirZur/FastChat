I'd prescribe her some anti-spasmodics, like megepsum or dicyclomine, to help her stomach muscles relax. I'd also give her some loperamide, to stop the diarrhea. I might give her some steroids, like prednisone, to calm her immune system, but I'd watch her closely, because they can make her moody.\n\nThen, I'd suggest some dietary changes. She should avoid dairy, because it can make her symptoms worse. She should eat bland, low-fiber foods like rice, chicken, and bananas, and drink lots of water.

Probability is like a game, for example, you roll a dice and you want to know how likely is that you get a 5. I'll explain it to you with some examples. If you don't get it, let me know.\n1. I'll roll a dice, what's the probability that I get a 5?\nIt's 1/6, in other words, 16,66% (remember, it's the number of times you get a 5 divided by the total number of times you do the experiment). I'll do it another time.\n2. I'll roll a dice, what's the probability that I get an even number?\nIt's 3/6 or 50%, because half of the numbers are even. I'll do it more times.\n3. I'll toss a coin 3 times, what's the probability that I get 2 heads?\nThe probability that I get a head is 1/2. The probability that I get 2 heads is the probability that I get a head in the first position multiplied by the probability that I get a head in the second position (because the first position doesn't affect the second one), so it's 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

The probability that I get a 6 in the second position is 1/6 too, but the first position is already taken, so I have to multiply it by 5 because there are 5 possible numbers.

In Euclidean geometry, the distance between two points is the length of the line that connects them, and that's it. In Riemannian geometry, it's more complicated. The distance depends on the way the surface is curved. In other words, the surface is not considered flat, so you can't measure the distance between two points as if they were in a plane, like in Euclidean geometry. The distance depends on the way the surface is curved.\n\nIn Riemannian geometry, angles between planes, lines, and anything that's not a point are also calculated differently than in Euclidean geometry. In Euclidean geometry, they are the same as in real life.\n\nIn Riemannian geometry, the way you calculate the surface area of an object is different too. It's called Riemannian integration.\n\nAlso, Riemannian geometry allows for things that don't exist in Euclidean geometry, like parallel lines that meet and curved lines that are shorter than other lines between the same points.\n\nIn short, the main difference is that Riemannian geometry is the way to study curved surfaces, curved lines, and curved spaces, while Euclidean geometry is for flat spaces and straight lines.\n\nThe concepts of Riemannian geometry, like Riemannian metrics and Riemannian manifolds, are used in many areas of math and science, such as physics, computer graphics, and statistics."]}], "tstamp": 1717540498.8508008}

Finally, you can call the function with the path of the directory.\n\nhere's the code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport os\n\ndef get_top_words(path):\n    words = {}\n    for file in os.listdir(path):\n        with open(os.path.join(path, file), 'r') as f:\n            for line in f:\n                for word in line.split():\n                    words[word] = words.get(word, 0) + 1\n    return list(Counter(words.values()).most_common(5))\n\nprint(get_top_words('C:/Users/your_user/Desktop/'))\n```\n\nnote: you need to replace `C:/Users/your_user/Desktop/` with the path of your directory.", "I can't do that. But I can give you an example:\n\n```\ndef fib(n, a, b)\n  if n == 0\n    a\n  else\n    fib(n-1, b, a+b)\n  end\nend\n\ndef fib_parallel(n, a, b)\n  def fib_worker(n, a, b)\n    if n == 0\n      a\n
